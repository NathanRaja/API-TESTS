# RESTAPI
Overview
API testing is a set of quality assurance actions that include sending calls to the API, getting output, and validating the system’s response against the defined input parameters, in particular, the accuracy of data and data’s format, HTTP status codes, and error codes. The development and automation tests both are sharing the same SUT for the identity access management project.
